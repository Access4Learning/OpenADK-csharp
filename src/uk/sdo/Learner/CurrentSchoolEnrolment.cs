/// <summary>This container reflects key enrolment data for the current or current main (home) school or establishment linked to a learner.  An agent may operate more efficiently if the data represented here is sufficient.  If the agent requires more data or needs to retrieve enrolment data from all enroled schools then it may still need to request some or all LearnerSchoolEnrolment objects for the learner.  This information should always be specified when there is an active enrolment.  It must also accurately reflect the data in the represented LearnerSchoolEnrolment object and generate change events for this object when change events are detected for LearnerSchoolEnrolment.</summary>
