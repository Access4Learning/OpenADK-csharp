    /// Load Balancing Batons provide a conceptually simple way to implement internal
    /// load balancing for arbitrary tasks. A LoadBalancer is configured with a pool
    /// of batons that may be checked out by threads. When a baton is checked out,
    /// the calling thread has the right to perform the operation associated with the
    /// baton. When finished, it returns the baton to the LoadBalancer's pool of
    /// batons so that other threads may now perform the task.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For example, if one of the resource-intensive tasks your agent performs is
    /// to respond to SIF_Requests for "all students", create a LoadBalancer instance
    /// to represent this task. Whenever a SIF_Request is received for "all students",
    /// obtain a Baton from the LoadBalancer. If the baton is received, you may carry
    /// out the task at hand by querying the database for all students and returning
    /// those students as StudentPersonal objects. If the baton is not received in
    /// the timeout period, throw a SIFException with category 10 ("Transport Error"),
    /// which instructs the ZIS to keep the message in the agent's queue for later
    /// retry.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// When an agent is unable to obtain a Baton in response to a SIF_Request, it
    /// should put the agent to sleep until the load has relaxed. The LoadBalancer
    /// class offers a simple way to achieve this. When requesting a Baton times out,
    /// call the Zone.sleep method to put the agent to sleep. Next, register a
    /// LoadBalancerListener with the LoadBalancer. When the LoadBalancer has a
    /// free pool of available batons greater than 1, it will call your listener's
    /// onBatonsAvailable method. You can then call Zone.wakeup to wakeup the agent,
    /// signaling the ZIS that it may continue sending messages.
